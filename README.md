# Contract Deployer Template

The deployer template script is a tool to streamline the deployment of contracts between scripts and unit tests. Sharing a single script during testing and production deployment reduces the risk of errors and allows to test the deployment process in advance.

## Requirements

The script utilizes Node.js to run. We recommend the node version defined in the `.nvmrc` file.

## Installation

```bash
forge install 0xPolygon/contract-deployer-template
```

## Usage Example

The following command will create a deployer contract for the `MyExample` contract from the `src/Example.sol` file in the `test/deployers/MyExampleDeployer.s.sol` file.

```bash
node lib/contract-deployer-template -c src/Example.sol -o test/deployers -n MyExample
```
